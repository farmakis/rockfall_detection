# rockfall_detection
This is a 3D rockfall detection project based on point cloud classification with @PointNet and PointNet++ models. The repository includes Tensorflow 2 implementations of the models to separate between rockfalls an other deformation clusters detected within rock slope change detection programs.

# Installation
The codes have been tested with:
  - python
